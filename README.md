Team Jar Openers

Organization & Work Procedures:

Our team used a distributed version control strategy in which the master/main repo was created on dcmcdermott/jar-openers-file-search and all contributing team members forked
the repo and cloned to their local machines to make changes. Team members commited to their forks and submitted pull requests to origin master. After code review, pull requests
were merged into main/master. The team prioritized communication using email and text messaging. To manage our backlog and keep everyone on the same page we used trello
boards which can be seen here: https://trello.com/b/XJmR52mn/file-search-gui. Team members would grab an item from the backlog and move it to 'In Progress', 'Pull Requested',
and 'Complete' boards as each backlog item was developed.
